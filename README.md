> The Odin Project - HTML project
### What's this?
* My attempt to study web in the Odin Project, basically.
* This is a practice of HTML from me.
* And maybe to decorate my CV a tiny tiny bit more.

### Overview
* Pure HTML, little to no CSS or JS (or what ever there is on WA).
*  [The Odin Project - Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

### What do I want to do here?
* Solidify whatever I have read on The Odin Project about HTML.
* Master of boilerplates. Well, I will probably automate it with a shell file one day. I hate boilerplate. We all hate boilerplate.
* (In all seriousness, I had more joy writing this Markdown thing than HTML).
